Helping people be more productive.
Currently developing this as part of my Computer Science project. 

Download the latest compiled jar file from the scheduler branch <a href="https://goo.gl/ofeCKb">here</a>.

Note: the code in the master branch is quite outdated - I haven't merged it with the scheduler branch yet.
So if you want to check out the code for the latest build, be sure to look at the scheduler branch <a href="https://github.com/DMeechan/simply-done/tree/scheduler">here</a>.

~~Once that's complete, I'll likely continue adding new features, like a task scheduler.~~

Scratch that, I ended up implementing the task scheduler anyway. 
When I have more ideas for features to add, I'll add them after exams.
