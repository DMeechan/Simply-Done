# simply-done
Helping people be more productive.
Currently developing this as part of my Computer Science project. 

Download the latest compiled jar file from the scheduler branch <a href="https://github.com/DMeechan/simply-done/blob/scheduler/Simply%20Done.jar?raw=true">here</a>.

~~Once that's complete, I'll likely continue adding new features, like a task scheduler.~~

Scratch that, I ended up spending the last 15 hours implementing the task scheduler anyway. 
When I have more ideas for features to add, I'll add them after exams.
